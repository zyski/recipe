# Artisan Ratios

Some basic ratios for developing your own recipes. Start with strong flour as 100% and alter the rest depending on the goal of the recipe.

# Bread

- 100% strong Flour
- 60-85% Liquid. Up to 50% non water. Up to 25% egg.
- 3-5% yeast. Rich dough = more yeast.
- 0-10% sugar. Softness and moisture.
- 2-4% Salt (or Vinegar). Aids fermentation.
- 0-10% Fat (shortening). Shortens gluten. Tenderness to crumb.
