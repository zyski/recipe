# Shortcrust Pastry

## Ingredients

- 100g unsalted **Butter**
- 200g plain **Flour**
- 0.25tsp **Salt**
- 1 **Egg**
- Some **Water**

## Method - Theromix

Add cubbed **Butter**, **Flour** and **Salt**. Blend on speed 4.5 until the butter is well incorporated with the flour.

With the motor still running add the **Egg**. As the dough forms add a little bit of **Water** until the right consistency is achieved.

Remove the dough, roll into a ball, cover in plastic wrap and refridgerate for at least 30mins before using.

## Notes

For best results keep ingredients cold.

Cooking time will vary slightly on how you use it, however **20-30mins** at **200Â°C** usually works well.
