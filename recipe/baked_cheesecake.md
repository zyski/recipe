# Baked Cheesecake

## Ingredients

- 250g plain semi-sweet **biscuits**
- 120g unsalted **butter**
- 500g **cream cheese**
- 2 tbsp plain **flour**
- 1 tsp **vanilla** extract
- 125g sour **cream**
- 330g caster **sugar**
- Zest of 1 **lemon**
- 3 **eggs**

## Method

Turn the **biscuits** into fine crumbs using a food processor (or crush using a rolling pin etc).

Melt the **butter** and mix with the biscuits.

Add mixture to a greased and lined 20cm spring form cake pan, pressing the crumb up the sides first, followed by the base.

Place in fridge while preparing the filling.

In a large mixing bowl, beat the **cream cheese** until smooth.

Add **flour**, beat until combined.

Add **vanilla**, **sour cream**, **sugar** and **lemon zest**. Beat until combined.

Add **eggs**, one at a time, beating each one until combined.

Pour mixture into prepared base.

Bake at **140&deg;C** for **55mins**. Top should be a very light golden brown, and jiggle slightly when shaken gently.

Cool in the oven with door open for approx 30mins before refrigerating for 4+ hours.

## Notes

McVitie's Digestive or Arnott's Marie work well for the **biscuits**.

Take care not to aerate (over beat) the mixture as it will rise when baked, then fall into disappointment.
