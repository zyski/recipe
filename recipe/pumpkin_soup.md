## Method

In a large saucepan....

Sauté diced **onion** in **butter** for a few minutes then add diced **bacon**.  Continue to fry until both start to get a nice golden brown colour.

Add pealed and cubed **pumpkin**.

Add **water** until a few peaks of pumpkin are still above the water level. Stir everything.

Simmer (with lid on), stirring occasionally until the pumpkin starts to fall apart.

Let it cool a little then blend with a stick blender, food processor, whisk etc.
