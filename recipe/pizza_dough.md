# Pizza Dough

## Ingredients

- 620g **water**
- 18g **sugar**
- 9g **instant yeast**
- 900g **strong wholemeal flour**
- 18g **salt**

NB: extra **flour** (your choice) is required to help knead and roll out the dough.

## Method

Mix **water**, **sugar**, and **yeast** and let stand until yeast starts to
froth.

Add **flour** and **salt** and mix util all flour is moist. Cover and let stand
for 10mins.

Knead dough for 5-10mins, cover and let rest for 2-8hrs.

Divide dough into four. Knead each piece for approx 1-2mins then shape into
a ball and dust with flour. Cover and let rest for 30mins to 1hr.

Roll out a ball, top, then bake at **250&deg;C** for **9-10mins**.

## Notes

Scale this recipe using the flour weight. Everything else is a percentage:

- 100% flour
- 68% water (but this depends on the flour)
- 1% yeast
- 2% salt
- 2% sugar

Kneading by hand can be done in many ways. The important part is ensuring the
dough is flattened (by stretching), folded onto itself, then rotated about a
quarter turn. Repeat.

Use a sieve to dust flour onto the dough / bench / rolling pin.

Ideally have your flour & water at a temperature of 25-40&deg;C as most yeast
will work best in this range.

While the recipe calls for strong wholemeal flour (>11% protein), most plain
flour will work just fine.
