# Notes

Although called banana bread, this is really a cake, mixed using the wet method.

This recipe calls for equal quantities of butter, sugar, eggs and flour. Normally best measured out by weight starting with the eggs. Then adjust the other ingredients to match the weight of the eggs.

The bicarbonate soda activates (turns to gas to make bubbles) from the acid in old bananas. If you are using fresh bananas then you may need to boost the recipe with something acidic like cream of tartar (use equal quantities of bicarbonate soda and cream of tartar).
