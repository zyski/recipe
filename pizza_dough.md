# Pizza dough

## Ingredients

- 20g **Olive Oil**
- 260g **Water**
- 8g instant **Yeast**
- 400g strong **Flour**
- 10g **Salt**

## Method - Theromix

Add **flour**, **salt** and **yeast** to a seperate bowl and mix.

Add **olive oil** and **water** to Theromix.

Add the **dry ingredients** in the seperate bowl to Thermoix. 2:00/0/Dough.

Lightly kneed the dough until the dough comes together well ~1min.

Divide dough in half, rolling each half in into a ball. Place each ball in an oiled bowl, cover and let prove for approx 1-2h.

Flatten each ball onto a floured surface then transfer to a pizza peel or pizza tray and add toppings.

## Notes

Cooking depends on the result you want, toppings used etc. Cooking on a pizza stone at **240Â°C for 7mins** works pretty well.

A simple way to knead dough in your hands:

- dry and flour hands
- flatten to rough oval using fingers and thumb (about the size of 1-2 hands)
- fold in half
- quarter turn
- repeat

Ratios based on wholemeal flour, you will need to reduce the liquid if using a less absorbent flour such as white.
