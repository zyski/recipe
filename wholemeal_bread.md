## Ingredients

- 480g strong wholemeal **Flour**
- 1.5tsp **Salt**
- 0.5tsp instant **Yeast**
- 325g **Water**
- 50g grapeseed **Oil**

Add the **water**, **oil** and **honey** then mix until all ingredients are well combined.

Cover the dough and let rest at room temperature for at least 10 hours.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, stetching and folding once. Shape and place into a oil and floured bread tin.

Cover the dough and let rest at room temperature for a further 1-2 hours.

Bake the dough in a dutch oven for 30min at 240°C, remove the lid and bake a further 15mins at 200°C.

Let cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour prior to slicing.

## Notes

The dough created by this recipe will be wet and sticky so use dough scrapers, oiled or floured hands etc to work with it.

Mixing the dough can be done using a machine, a dough mixer or even a teaspoon. Using a teaspoon is as simple as mixing in a circle near the centre until the dough starts to come together then gradually work your way out to the sides.

A plasic shopping bag can be used to cover the dough for the first rising, place the mixing bowl inside and twist the ends to seal.

The first rise is done when the dough starts to bubble a litte on top. If in doubt approx 12 hours should be enough.

There are various techniques to stretch and fold a wet dough. One method is to flatten out slightly, folding the left third into the middle, then the right third into the middle, then the top edge to meet the bottom edge. The dough is then placed seem side down.

The second rising won't increase in volume too much, but it should rise.

A dutch oven is used for cooking as it traps steam inside, produced from the wet dough. This steam delays the crust forming on the bread so that the bread can achieve a final rise i.e. oven spring.
